This course uses the eShopOnContainers as its starting point. This system uses a number of different architectures, patterns, and tools. We will be focusing on the ones related to DDD.

## Step 1: Install prerequisites

Follow the instructuctions for [System Requirements](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/wiki/System-requirements), depending on your platform (Windows and Mac).

Visual Studio provides the optimum debugging experience but it's not required for this course.

Dependending on your platform, continue with the link in the "setup wiki page".

## Step 2 Setup

Follow the instructions for:
- Install Docker Desktop
- Configure Docker Desktop
  - The "File sharing" step may not be needed
- SKIP "Configure local networking"
- Build and deploy eShopOnContainers
  - STOP after step 2 if using Visual Studio
- Use Visual Studio (or Use Visual Studio for Mac)
- Server side (Microservices and web applications) - Workloads
